# riverhealth

<!-- badges: start -->
This document outlines the process for using a R package to calculate the New Zealand River Ecosystem Health Score, as proposed by Clapcott et al. (2019). The score serves as a simple and holistic measure of the biophysical condition of rivers and streams in New Zealand. It is based on the Freshwater Biophysical Ecosystem Health Framework and evaluates five core components of ecosystem health: *Aquatic Life*, *Physical Habitat*, *Water Quality*, *Water Quantity*, and *Ecological Processes*.

## Installation

You can install the development version of riverhealth from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("cawthron/riverhealth")
```

## Preparing data 

Before using `riverhealth`, it is assumed that users have followed the steps required to apply the Freshwater Biophysical Ecosystem Health Framework (Figure 1). This package assists users in **Step 1** by providing default reference values for metrics, in **Step 2** by harmonising and integrating data, and in **Step 3** by calculating performance scores and plots for ecosystem health reporting. Users must complete other steps in the process before using this tool. Such as the establishment of representative monitoring sites, data collection, metric calculation, and data aggregation to a chosen spatial and temporal scale (e.g., the calculation of a 5-yr median for a given site).

## Reference table

A nationally applicable reference table is provided with the package. This table provides default values for excellent ecological condition (minimum human impact) as well as for poor ecological condition (e.g., national bottom lines) for metrics against which sites are compared with to calculate performance scores. The reference table was populated using best available information.

For attributes in the National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management (NPSFM) 2020, the default values are provided in Tables in Appendix 2A and 2B. In this tool, the metric value denoting an A band was used for excellent condition and the metric value denoting the national bottom line was used for poor condition. Exceptions include: Dissolved reactive phosphorus and Fish Index of Biotic Integrity, where the metric value denoting the D band was used for poor condition; Ecosystem metabolism (both gross primary production and ecosystem respiration) default values were informed by Young et al. (2008) and STAG Report to the Minister for the Environment (2019). For attributes not in the NPSFM, the references used to inform default guidelines values can be found in the Appendix.

We recommend using the reference table provided with the package. The default reference table is included with the package and can be accessed once the package is installed as `reference_table_default`:

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(riverhealth)

kableExtra::kable(reference_table_default)  

```

Each row corresponds to a different metric and each column denotes:

- **component:**  Each component describes a different aspect of freshwater biophysical ecosystem health.
- **indicator:** Within a component, indicators aggregate similar metrics. This column denotes the indicator to which a given metric belongs to.
- **attribute:** The biophysical attributes a given metric aims to quantify. The attribute classification often matches the metric classification, but it can vary when multiple metrics measure the same attribute(e.g., both the *do_7_day_min* and *do_1_day_min* metrics measure the *dissolved oxygen* attribute).
- **metric:** Measured or modeled biophysical characteristics of rivers and streams.
- **class:** The category used for calculating metric performance scores (e.g., productive/default, sediment class). Different categories will have different benchmarks.
- **bottom_line:** This numerical value is a benchmark that denotes a degraded state or poor condition for a given metric, against which sites will be compared to calculate performance scores.
- **bottom_line_range:** For non-linear metrics only, these values denote the range that comprises a degraded state for a given metric. If the metric is linear, then this column should be NA.
- **reference:** This numerical value is a benchmark that denotes a healthy state or excellent condition for a given metric, against which sites will be compared to calculate performance scores.
- **reference_line_range:** For non-linear metrics only, these values denote the range that comprises a healthy state for a given metric. If the metric is linear, then this column should be NA.
- **cut:** For NPSFM metrics, this numerical value is the benchmark that denotes metric grades between the **bottom_line** and the **reference** values (e.g., delineating B/C grades). These values are only used to calculate NPSFM grade bands and are not used to calculate metric performance scores.
- **healthy_value:** A categorical value that denotes whether high or low values of a metric indicate a healthy stream. Categories are *high*, *low*, or *non-linear*.
- **NPSFM:** A Boolean variable (*TRUE* or *FALSE*) denoting if a metric is part of the National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management 2020.
- **suitability:** A numerical value (*1*, *2*, or *3*) for each metric, assigned using expert assessment to quantify if metrics are fit for purpose. These values are used in the data integration process.
- **key_metric:** A Boolean variable denoting if a metric is necessary for a holistic assessment of a river or stream. Metrics denoted as key metrics will be used to calculate plotting ratios of each indicator.

If the user needs to apply different benchmarks (e.g., to account for regional guideline values or spatial variation), they can use their own user-defined reference table. However, a user-defined reference table must follow the exact same format as the default reference table. The final output will indicate whether the default or user-defined benchmarks were used. We recommend the user employ best practice guidelines to inform alternative benchmarks, such as those used in Clapcott et al (2019).

A note on metric **suitability** values. In the default reference table, these were assigned using the following logic: All metrics with tables in Appendix 2A and 2B of the NPSFM 2020 were assigned a 3, indicating high suitability. Metrics with standardised methods and/or national datasets and/or national guideline values were assigned a 2, indicating medium suitability. Remaining metrics that did not meet the above definitions or only provided partial assessment of an indicator compared to an alternative metric (e.g., *taxa_richness* compared to *fish_ibi*) were assigned a 1, indicating low suitability. 

A note on **key_metric** identification. Metrics were labelled as key metrics if they contributed to a holistic assessment of ecological integrity, which includes nativeness, pristineness, diversity, and resilience, where applicable. Each indicator must contain at least one key metric even if that metric has low suitability. For example, plant *exotic_species* is a key metric despite a suitability of 1 because there are no alternative metrics assessing nativeness.

## Preparing data - Indicator tables

Within each component, indicator tables should be prepared independently. Each table should be presented as a tidy data frame, where each variable constitutes a column, and each observation forms a row. The data in these tables should already be aggregated at the desired level for analysis. For example, as detailed in Clapcott et al. (2019), data were aggregated at the site level using the mean average for the given period (e.g. 2013-2017).

Each indicator table must include the following columns:

- **site:** The unique identifier for the spatial scale at which observations were aggregated (e.g. NZSegment, Site name).
- **class:** The category of a given site in the context of the metrics being measured  (e.g. productive/default for *periphyton*, sediment class for *visual_clarity*).
-	**indicator:** This column denotes the indicator to which the given metrics belong to. Values in this column should be an exact match to the indicators listed in the **Reference Table**.
- **component:** This column denotes the component to which the given metric/s belong to. Values in this column should be an exact match to the components listed in the **Reference Table**.
-	**reporting_scale:** The chosen scale for data integration. This could be, for example, Freshwater Management Unit, region, or stream class. This column should be the same for all indicator tables for calculating an ecosystem health score. The names for all reporting scales should be consistent across all indicator tables.
-	**individual metric columns:** Each metric observed or modelled should have its own column, containing the respective metric values for evaluating the indicator. At least one metric column is required. Column names should be an exact match to the metrics listed in the **Reference Table** (eg., *fish_ibi*, *qmci*).

As an example, all subsequent analyses will show how to calculate health scores for the  *Aquatic Life* component using simulated data. This data is provided with the package. The first few rows of the `macroinvertebrates` indicator table show:
